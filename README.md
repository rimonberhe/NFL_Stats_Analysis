# nflstats

Using Jupyter Notebook to follow my work more easily, I am showcasing some simple analysis of NFL stats data using various Python packages such as Pandas and NumPy. I am also using the Python package matplotlib to visualize the data and make it easier to understand. I chose to analyze my favorite NFL team the Carolina Panthers and their quarterback Cam Newton. I find data analysis to be such a fun and rewarding task especially when the data you are manipulating, cleaning, or visualzing has interest to you.
